# todo (web application exploitation) Walkthrough

|      **Challenge Type**      | **Difficulty** |               **Flag format/question format**                |
| :--------------------------: | :------------: | :----------------------------------------------------------: |
| Web application exploitation |     Medium     | 1. Name of the Vulnerability used to find the flag<br />2. Flag found in the admin users cookies<br />3. What is the User Agent of the account the flag was extracted from? |

## Challenge summary

In this challenge, we will are told that there is a flag hidden in the admin users cookies in the [todo list website](https://01a7fb2d2a274676736681e968dec6e2-todo.web.cityinthe.cloud). The admin users supposedly checks the todo list to make sure that their employees are doing their tasks. We need to answer the following questions:

1. Name of the Vulnerability used to find the flag
2. The flag found in the admin users cookies
3. What is the User Agent of the account the flag was extracted from?

## Setup

For this challenge, all that is needed is a web browser that has developer tools enabled. For this challenge, we'll be using [Firefox](https://www.firefox.com), as I find their developer tools are the easiest to use and provide information to the user concisely. It is also useful to use a browser other than your primary browser, as it can prevent you from accidentally modifying your primary browsers state.  Here is an example of what Firefox developer tools, specifically the network tab would look like.

## Instructions

1. The first step is to load up the website in the browser of choice (In this case, Firefox) and open developer tools, using either the shortcut `Shift+Control+I` or clicking the overflow menu, the other tools and then web developer tools.

2. Once you have opened the developer tools, you should see something like this (or a different tab in the developer tools):

3. For almost all web application challenges, one of the most basic skills is to look at the source code of the website. This can be quite intimidating for someone who is unfamiliar with HTML as a language, so it could be helpful to use resources such as [MDN web docs-HTML](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML) or even artificial intelligence to help explain code. 
   Of particular interest when examining code is any references to `script.js` or any external scripts that the website relies on. This is often where vulnerabilities in the website can be located. 
   To view the code, click on the `inspector` tab in the browsers developer tools and view the code. Click the triangles to expand the sections of code to view what is in them.

4. Looking at the code, we can see a line that references an external script. 

   ```html
   <script src="/static/app.js" defer="defer"></script>
   ```

   We can `control+click` on the `/static/app.js` to view the file and can analyze its purpose.

   ```js
   async function addItem(event) {
     event.preventDefault();
     const item = document.getElementById('item');
     const { value } = item;
     await fetch('/item', {
       method : 'POST',
       headers : {
         'Content-Type' : 'application/json',
       },
       body : JSON.stringify({ item : btoa(value) }),
     });
     window.location.reload();
   }
   
   const form = document.getElementById('items');
   form.addEventListener('submit', addItem);
   
   ```

   If you are unfamiliar with JavaScript, it could be helpful to view the [MDN Web Docs for JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/). 

5. To understand where the vulnerability lies, it is important to break down the function to understand its purpose. Some things to look out for:

   1. Expected input (what is expected to be inputted into the function)
   2. Expected output (what is expected to be outputted by this function)
   3. Actual input (what input is actually allowed)
   4. Actual output (what is actually outputted by the function)

   ```js
   async function addItem(event) {  // Function definition- add item (on event)
     // Get the item that the user has entered into the input field and assign it to the item variable 
     event.preventDefault();
     const item = document.getElementById('item');
     const { value } = item;
   // Create a post request traveling to the item endpoint with the value that the user enters into the input field. Notice how the input is not being validated or standardized before sending to the POST request  
     await fetch('/item', {
       method : 'POST',
       headers : {
         'Content-Type' : 'application/json',
       },
       body : JSON.stringify({ item : btoa(value) }),
     });
     window.location.reload();
   }
   
   const form = document.getElementById('items');
   form.addEventListener('submit', addItem);
   ```

6. After looking at the code of the function we can identify a possible vulnerability in the function- user input into the function is not validated.
