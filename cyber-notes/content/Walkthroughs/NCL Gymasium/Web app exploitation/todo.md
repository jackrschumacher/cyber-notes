## Challenge summary

In this challenge, we will are told that there is a flag hidden in the admin users cookies in the [todo list website](https://01a7fb2d2a274676736681e968dec6e2-todo.web.cityinthe.cloud). The admin users supposedly checks the todo list to make sure that their employees are doing their tasks. We need to answer the following questions:

1. Name of the Vulnerability used to find the flag
2. The flag found in the admin users cookies
3. What is the User Agent of the account the flag was extracted from?

## Setup

For this challenge, all that is needed is a web browser that has developer tools enabled. For this challenge, we'll be using [Firefox](https://www.firefox.com), as I find their developer tools are the easiest to use and provide information to the user concisely. It is also useful to use a browser other than your primary browser, as it can prevent you from accidentally modifying your primary browsers state.  Here is an example of what Firefox developer tools, specifically the network tab would look like.

## Instructions

1. The first step is to load up the website in the browser of choice (In this case, Firefox) and open developer tools, using either the shortcut `Shift+Control+I` or clicking the overflow menu, the other tools and then web developer tools.

2. Once you have opened the developer tools, you should see something like this (or a different tab in the developer tools):
